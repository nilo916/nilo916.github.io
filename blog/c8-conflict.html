	      I was trying to think of some kind of conflict that had arisen. The last one I could think of was when I got into an argument about a movie with someone and it turned into a big thing about me feeling slighted by him.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        I think the main source of the conflict was that he made me feel disrespected and that my opinions on things weren't valid. He in turn said that I didn' listen to what he was saying. At first I was upset and angry but we talked out the whole thing so it ended up getting resolved.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	If I could go back I probably would have said something sooner. I let the situation get to a boiling point before I said something. I didn't learn anything new. I know I bottle things up and I shouldn't. Ive been getting better about it though.
