	Welcome to my humble little blog. I'm going to do my best to fill your mind full of all kinds of technobabble.

	  When you think about a cycle usually something that goes around over and over in a loop comes to mind. in the case of the enumerable cycle that's essentially what you're getting.
	  Cycle calls a block for each element repeatedly 'n' times. If you don't specify what 'n' is then the cycle will run infinitely. If you identify 'n' with a negative number or the collection is empty then the cycle won't do anything.
	</p>
	<p> One thing to note about cycle is that it stores the elements in an internal array. That being said, any changes made to the enumerable after the first pass have no effect on the cycle.
