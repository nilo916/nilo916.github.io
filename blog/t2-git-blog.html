	Welcome to my humble little blog. I'm going to do my best to fill your mind full of all kinds of technobabble.

	For this handy dandy little post I to talk about the margin, border, and padding These are essentially what would be the area around the content. An example of what content is would be the tect of a paragraph.    </p>
	    <p>
	        In a block the next thing out from the content is the padding. This is what you would use to increase or decrease the space from the content ot the border. The border is obviously next out from the content after the padding. By changin this you would increase the size of the border. Beyond the border is the margin. This is the space between the border and the edge of the body.

	  These are used to help with the positioning in your html. It really helps with organizing your site in a way that is appealing to the eye.
