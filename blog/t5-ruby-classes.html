	      Welcome to a gathering of Lords and Ladies, Kings and Queens, Nobleman and Noblewomen... You see where this is going. Themes are always important for a rousing good time. If you haven't figured it out yet, the theme is, like the title says, the ruling classes.
	      By the I mean classes in Ruby obviously. I don't know about the rest of you but my social circle is lacking in the royalty department.

	        What is a class in Ruby then? Well classes are essentially a way to organize objects and methods. A class usually consists of a collection of method definitions. You would use this on an object. You would start it by putting Object.new and then what ever parameter you want to work with. It would run the object through multiple methods to give you the answer you wanted.

	    	What would you use this for? It would be best to put it in terms of some example. I figure why not use Pokemon! People love pokemon but these days it's getting hard to keep up. There are so many now and so many things to know about each of them it's hard to keep it all straight. This is where you would use a class. The class would be Pokemon and the object would be whichever pokemon you want to look at. Inside the class you could create methods to keep track of the pokemon for any number of things. You could create a class keeps track of them by Pokedex number, height, weight, type, strengths, weaknesses, etc. You can see why a class would be really helpful
