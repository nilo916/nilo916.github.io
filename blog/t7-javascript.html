	    	This week was the first week of working in Javascript after having spent 4 weeks on Ruby. There are bound to be some issues going between the two languages. Let's look at something that is appropriate considering the theme of the cultural blog this week. 
		</p>
	    <p>
	    	Let's take a look at values in both of these languages.
	    	One thing that both of them have in common is the fact that a variable can have strings, numbers, or booleans.

	    	In ruby values are pretty rigid. If you tried to call a method on the wrong type of object it will give you an error. An example of this would be if you took "6"+2. This would give you a TypeError because you can't add a fixed number to a string

	    	Now let's take a look at how JS would work with the values. A value in JS is much more flexible than its Ruby counterpart. In JS a method can change the value of a variable. If you had "4" + 2 you wouldn't get an error. It would convert 4 to a fixnum and return 6! Not only that but if you took the 6 and made it 6+ "4"
	    	it would convert it back to a string and return "10"

	    	I hope that was a helpful look into the values between the 2 languages.
