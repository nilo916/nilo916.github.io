	      I've been thinking about Dev Bootcamp a lot after week 1. It has been stressful for me to do all of these things on my own having no prior experience with bash. It was something else that's for sure. There were definitely times where I thought it was too difficult. There was a point where I thought to myself "Why isn't the answer here?" That was when it hit me. I was expecting it to be handed to me. It was like I was in some mindset of I paid for this now give me results. I remembered this is a means to accomplish something. I paid for an opportunity to learn how to succeed in this field. I need to work and learn to accomplish things. I'm only going to get out what I put in to this program.

	        Am I nervous about this whole process? I'l admit that I am. That's only because it's something new and exciting. It's pushing my boundaries past my comfort zone. I'm really excited to see what the next few weeks hold for me. I'm even more excited to get on site and really get in to things with the people in my cohort! Remote is fun but there's nothing like being surrounded by people who all have a similar mindset as you to accomplish something awesome!
