	      This week I have to relect on pairing and the feedback I've been given. I think so far the pairing has been fine. It hasn't been a negative experience for me. It really does help by showing me that I will be working with all different kinds of people and they they all bring something different to the table. I do find myself frustrated at times. I tend to be a bit more on the introverted side which tends me to prefer working on alone. I try not to ever let that influence me though as I work with other people. I remind myself that I will be working with others and I don't need to rely solely on myself.

	        I have been putting off looking at my feedback. I knew it wasn't going to be anything mean or hurtful. Having taken as many art classes as I have I'm well accustomed to receiving contructive criticism. Even having said that I was worried. There's always a part of you that doesn't want to see you did poorly at something. Having looked at them though, I did see essentially what I already knew I needed to work on. Thankfully there were no scathing reviews. I know I need to work on my terminology. I have trouble putting into words what I'm explaining. It's like me knowing what I want but telling someone "Hey do that thing".

	    	I do know that at times I have trouble with giving feedback. I should probably write it right after I have pairning sessions but I usually wait until after I've done them all for the week. This usually leaves me strained to think of each one individually. Even having said that though, I don't know that doing it immediately after would help me any. When I'm pairing with someone I'm too focused on what we're doing to take any real note of things they could improve on. Maybe I should try and notice more nuances of things they could work on.
