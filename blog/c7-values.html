	      This week we were given a table of words and asked to pick which ones coincided with our happiest, proudest, etc moments.
	      I looked at this list and only one of them really stood out to me. It was the word Challenge.

	    <p>
	    	You may wonder why that word. Well honestly it's because any noteworthy thing that I have achieved it was because someone challenged me.I don't mean in the sense that I was challenged to a race or anything. I mean it in terms of being doubted. I was challenged through a good portion of my life to feel like I needed to prove myself. There were people in my life that made me feel like I couldn't be good enough. I would always challenge that by doing what they said I couldn't do. I always take the challenges to prove my worth because I know I'm worthy of everything I achieve.

	    <p>
	    	I don't really know the answer to the next part. I can't remember the last time someone asked me for advice. I'm usually the one that listens to people when they need to talk. I don't know that I've offered any key advice lately though.

			I don't know that the value I picked from this would help with stereotype threat but I do listen to people. I like to know all sides of the story and be something of a mediator. As far as cheering myself up at DBC usually some fresh air or coffee will do the trick for me.
