	      It has been awhile since I thought about what my thinking style was in regards to what Gregoric  researched. I decided to retake the quiz and got a similar score as I remembered. I had scored somewhat evenly in all the categories. In a way, that's great because I should have the flexibility to use any of the thinking styles to my benefit. I think that being the case brings in the "Jack of all trades" scenario. I feel like no thinking style in particular works better for me than another. It seems like I'm always trying some different way to process information. There are times when I do things multiple ways. The thing that so far seems to have the most impact on me is my workspace.

	       I feel like that leads into what has been the biggest struggle for me so far in Phase 0. I need a a dedicated place to do work that I can focus on. As of now I have no real place to work at in my apartment apart fom my bed or the floor. It leads me to become unfocused and I get distracted by other things that much easier. I've been looking into setting up a desk hopfully within the next week. Having a place to really sit down and do work will help me in the many ways i learn things.

	    	For me i think the best way to increase my learning potential will be to try more types of things that involve practice.It feels like so often I just write down the simple facts but I don't actively apply them. I think if I took more time topractice what I learn I would do much better .
