	Welcome to my humble little blog. I'm going to do my best to fill your mind full of all kinds of technobabble.
	</p>
	    <p>
	This time we have arrays and hashes. Two things that are similar and also different.</p>
	    <p>
	        Arrays and hashes are collections of objects in the code. An array is a collection of objects whose key is a number value.
	        A typical array could look like this:
	        	
	        
	        	array_name = [3, "banana", 7.095]


	        If you wanted to call one of these then you would need to use a key. As mentioned before, an array will have a key set to a numerical value. If you wanted to call the string "banana" you would do this:

	        	array_name[1]

	        The second part of the array has a key value of 1 because the values in an array start at 0. If you wanted to call the last part of the array you could do this:

	        	array_name[2] or array_name[-1]

	        It's easy to know what number to use if you have a small array but what if it's a much larger array and you don't know what the key value of the last number is? The key values also go in reverse from 0. That means if you want the last number you just need to call
	        -1.  
	    </p>
	<p>
	  If we look at hashes they are similar to arrays. You use these to also hold collections of objects. The difference here being that the keys can have any value. 
	  A hash could look something like this:

	  animals = {
	  	'dog'  		=>  'mammal'
	  	'cat'  		=>  'mammal'
	  	'frog' 		=>  'amphibian'
	  	'lizard'    =>  'reptile'
	}

	As you can see the values for the keys in this case happen to be strings. When you use hashes you have to make sure to put two values: you need one for the key and one for the other value. With this example say you wanted to call 'cat'. It would look like this:

		animals['cat']

		It would return

		'mammal'

	A hash is good if you want to put a collection of objects in to specific groups. While hashes do offer more flexibility, arrays are much more efficient to access.
