	    	This week is on the issue of Stereotype Threat that people face in life. Specifically I was looking into imposter syndrome as it resonated more with me.

	    <p>
	        Essetially imposter syndrome is when no matter how much success someone may achieve they still believe that they are not actually successful. It is like feeling not good enough even when the evidence contradicts it. I decided to focus on this part because I really feel like I resonate with the issue of imposter syndrome.

	  		My whole life I have strived to achieve success. For a good portion of it though it was simply to prove that I am capable. It can be difficult growing up and feeling like nothing is eve good enough. You spend so much time trying to prove yourself to other people that you forget that the only person you need to prove yourself to is you.

			I don't really want to go into too much detail on the personal issues but it's definitely hard. I have been struggling with this issue for well over a decade. I always have to remind myself that I am good enough and I that I am able to do things through my own ability. If I don't do this I quickly fall back into the old mindset and it pulls me back down. The best way I can think to change this, like I mentioned, is through self-affirmation. You need to give yourself approval and believe in your own abilities.
