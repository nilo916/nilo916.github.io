	    	This week's blog is about asking all the right questions. I didn't have any of my own on the group page to look at so I decided to look at the questions on StackOverflow.

	    	The main thing I noticed is details. If you want a goo answer you need to give a detailed question. If you were to simply ask, "I tried using this method in my code and it doesn't work" no one is going to be able to help you. The best questions that get the best answers are always the most specific. A question like that usually entails explaining what your goal for the code is and what isn't working in it. Also, posting the code you're working with helps immensly. The response to a question like this usually involves where your code went wrong, why it went wrong, what you should do to fix it, and a fixed example of the code you are working with.
