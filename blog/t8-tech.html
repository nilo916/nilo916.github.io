			I decided to make this week's blog about test driven development or TDD for short. What is it you ask? Well I suppose the simplest way to describe it is that you create a test first then create to the code to make that test pass.
		</p>
		<p>
			First you would want to write your test and just enough code to actually run the test even though it fails. Then you would run the test to make sure that it does  in fact fail. Once you've done that you can tinker with your code so that it passes the tests. Next you would want to run your test again. If your test fails again you simply rinse and repeat the ast two steps. Once the test passes you start the process over again for a new set of tests.
		</p>

			I know this offers a very basic explanation of what TDD is and how you would use it. I don't profess to be any sort of expert on the topic but I think it's a good method to take the time to look in to.	I'm going to include a link to a post that has a lot more information on TDD that I think would be a lot more beneficial to look at for this topic. I think this page is particularly useful because he created imgs to offer a visual understanding of the TDD process.
