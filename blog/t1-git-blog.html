	Welcome to my humble little blog. I'm going to do my best to fill your mind full of all kinds of technobabble.

	First off, let's start with version control. What is it? Well it's this nifty little thing that lets you save your work at certain points. I'm really quite fond on the analogy that it's like a save point in a video game. It is a point that you can go back to when something goes wrong instead of going all the way back to the beginning.    </p>

	        Git helps you keep track of changes through version control. When you use git you create commits that are like the "save points" that I had mentioned before. They create the points that you can rollback to is something in your code goes wrong.

	  The nice thing about doing this on GitHub is that it's an online repository for the work you do. Now you might wonder why you need it to be online since you are doing this on your own. That is exactly why you do it online, to do it with other people. It allows you to do your coding with other people. GitHub allows for others to see what changes you make in your code and offer suggestions and further commits to what you have already done. It makes it a great way to colaberate with other minds out there in cyber space!
